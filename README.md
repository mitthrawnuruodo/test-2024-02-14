Based on: https://dev.to/thedevdrawer/single-page-application-routing-using-hash-or-url-9jh

DOES NOT WORK WITH VS CODE LIVESERVER!

Limited support** on Netlify:

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/4b8d46ab-bc92-4d85-bd80-a3087152cdd3/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/test-2024-02-14/deploys)

** Cannot get to the 404, and direct links to ie. https://test-2024-02-14.netlify.app/about doesn't work. (I suspect that Netlify is a bit over eager in "helping".)
